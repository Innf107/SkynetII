# prophet-xcss

**This has nothing to do with xCSS! I just came up with the same name and noticed it was already taken later.**

This is a very simple preprocessor library for express to use different css styles for desktop and mobile. 

*prophet-xcss is completely backwards compatible with regular css.*

In your express server do this:
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const xcss = require('prophet-xcss')
const app = express()

app.use(xcss([__dirname])) //Include all directories, where you want to use prophet-xcss. FILE PATHS **HAVE** TO BE ABSOLUTE!
```

In your css you can just do this then:
```css
body{
    background-color: red + blue;
    /*This is now going to be red on desktop and blue on mobile*/

    font-size: _ + 200%;
    /*Use a _ if you want the property to not exist on one platform.*/
}
```

This gets served to a desktop user as
```css
body{
    background-color: red;
}
```

To a mobile user it will look like this
```css
body{
    background-color: blue;

    font-size: 200%;
}
```

# Options

**Fast Mode**
```javascript
app.use(xcss([__dirname], {fastMode:true}))
```

Fast mode is disabled by default.
Fast mode caches the final CSS, so it does not
have to recalculate the css for each request.
This can especially improve performance if you 
have a lot of CSS, but you have to restart your
server every time you change the CSS!
